# The best tkinter documentation

I started this page because despite the fact that tkinter is (one of) the most popular Python GUI framework(s), most of the documentation is only very superficial ([or it's on hiatus](https://effbot.org/) ðŸ˜•). A lot can only be learned from the source code or from the Tcl manual page.\So I want to change the fact that if someone gets stuck using tkinter, or just wants to know more about it, donâ€™t start asking questions on StackOverflow or Reddit, instead have a go-to page where are all the cool and understandable information, in detail and in Python tkinter format.\Secondly I also want to make a detailed documentation for tkinter extensions (e.g. tkcalendar, ttkwidgets, ttkthemes, etc.)

## My goal:

An useful, up-to date, user-friendly and modern go-to research tkinter documentation, with lots of cool, detailed and understandable information.


## Contributing:

First of all it is good if you can explain things well and understandably. No problem if you don't know html or css, if you can make documentation in txt or md format I'm also very happy.\I have areas of tkinter that I don't really know (e.g. canvas) and maybe there are some I haven't heard of, if something is wrong or missing please help to fix it!

I think it's very important that not only the documentation is good, but also the form in which it appears, so I made my best, but I'm sure, it can be better, if you can help I really apreciate it.
