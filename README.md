# A better tkinter documentation

#### I started this page because despite the fact that tkinter is one of the most popular Python GUI frameworks, most of the documentation is only very superficial ([or it's on hiatus](https://effbot.org/) ðŸ˜•). A lot can only be learned from the source code or from the Tcl manual page.<br>So I want to change the fact that if someone gets stuck using tkinter, or just wants to know more about it, donâ€™t start asking questions on StackOverflow or Reddit, instead have a page where you can find all the information you need, in detail and in tkinter format. <br>Secondly I also want to make a detailed documentation for tkinter extensions (e.g. tkcalendar, ttkwidgets, ttkthemes, etc.)

#### It's a very big job, if you can and want to help in any format, please drop me an email: rdbende@gmail.com!

### What can you contribute?

#### First of all it is good if you can explain things well and understandably (for me unfortunately it goes the worst). No problem if you don't know html or css, if you can make documentation in txt or md format I'm also very happy.<br>I have areas of tkinter that I don't really know (e.g. canvas) and maybe there are some I haven't heard of, if something is wrong or missing please help to fix it!

#### I think it's very important that not only the documentation is good, but also the form in which it appears, so please help in the website itself, if you know html and css, now a lot functionality is missing, which degrades the user experience.
