# A better Tkinter documentation

I started this page because despite the fact that tkinter is (one of) the most popular Python GUI framework(s), most of its documentation is very superficial ([or it's on hiatus](https://effbot.org/) ðŸ˜•). A lot can only be learned from the source code or from the Tcl manual pages.

So I wanted to change the fact that if someone gets stuck using Tkinter, or just wants to know more about it, donâ€™t start asking questions on StackOverflow or Reddit, instead have a go-to page where he can find information, resources and best practices in comprehensible and Pythonic format.
So my goal is to have a useful, up-to date, user-friendly and modern go-to research Tkinter documentation, with lots of cool, detailed and understandable information.

## Contributing:
First of all it is good if you can explain things well and understandably. No problem if you don't know HTML or CSS, if you can make documentation in txt or Markdown format I'd be also very happy. I have areas of Tkinter that I don't really know (e.g. canvas) and maybe there are some I haven't heard of, if something is wrong or missing please help to fix it!

I think it is very important that not only the documentation is good, but also the form in which it is presented, so I have done my best regarding the UI, but I am sure it can be better. If you can help, I really apreciate it.
