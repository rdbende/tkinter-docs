                    Well, if you’re on this site, you probably know what it is, but here you can read about it in detail.

                    Tkinter is Python's built-in standard GUI framework, which is a wrapper around the Tk GUI toolkit. Tk is written in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl" class="link" title="What is Tcl?" target="blank">Tcl language</a> but also used in other languages (Python, Ruby, Perl) and obviously in Python the <mark>Tk</mark> <mark>inter</mark>face is the module that gives us access to that. Tkinter is in Python's standard library, so you don't have to install a third party module, but may missing from some installations, in which case you need to install it separately.<br>You don't have to worry that your app won't work on another operating system because it's cross platform, and works almost exactly the same way everywhere. Tkinter is really easy to learn and  use, but without themed widgets it looks very ugly.
                </p>
                <h3>A short introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of the time, the <code>tkinter</code> and the <code>ttk</code> modules are needed when using tkinter, but there are more tkinter-related modules, such as the <code>filedialog</code> and the <code>messagebox</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tk interface itself is located in a binary module called <code>_tkinter</code>. This module contains the low-level interface to tk, and should never be used directly by application programmers. It is usually a shared library, or DLL, but might in some cases be statically linked with the Python interpreter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the <code>tkinter.constants</code> module are all tkinter constants are defined that can be used as keyword values, but we can also use strings instead. If you import tkinter, this module will be automatically imported, so you don't have to do it separately.
                </p>
                <h3>Hello, ttk!</h3>
                <p>
                    If you’ve ever created a tkinter app, you know it looks awful. Its appearance could be compared with <em>Win95</em>. It was not today, mainly not in design. Therefore, tkinter (ie. <em>tk</em>) has an extension module, called <code>ttk</code>. With which, you can make quite modern (platform-dependent) looking apps. This appearance is native to the operating system, so it looks different from Windows and Mac. Unfortunately, on Linux, there's not a big difference between the appearance of plain tkinter and the ttk widgets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another good thing that with ttk you able to set different themes (hence its name: <mark>t</mark>hemed <mark>tk</mark>). So if you’re not statisfied with the look of your app, you can create your own theme, get third party themes, or use great libraries like <a href="https://github.com/TkinterEP/ttkthemes" class="link" title="ttkthemes at TkinterEP">ttkthemes</a> or <a href="https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap" class="link" title="ttkbootstrap by Israel Dryer">ttkbootstrap</a>, for theming it really easily.<br>
                    Last but not least, ttk also has some new widgets compared to tkinter, but others are missing from it, so pay attention from which module do you use the widget.
                <h3>Importing</h3>
                <p>
                    And now a few words about importing, as many people don’t really use it <b>"well"</b>. Most tkinter apps begin like this:
                </p>
<pre title="Not so good import form">
<code class="language-python">from tkinter import *
</code></pre>       
                <p>
                    This is enough for a hello world program, but not good for other app, especially if you use ttk. You really do not want Tkinter to get involved in the global namespace! So this is the recommended import form:
                </p>
<pre title="Best import form for tkinter and ttk">
<code class="language-python">import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    But why?
                    <br>
                    In the first line we import tkinter as <code>tk</code>, to shorten its name, but keep a namespace. Second, we import ttk to make our app look modern.
                <h3>Notes for using this site</h3>
                <p>
                    This site assumes that you're somewhat familiar with Python and that you're using Python 3. There are some significant differences between the two, including module naming, which is the first thing you'll encounter when trying tkinter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't use plain tkinter widgets in our tutorials, only if it's specifically needed, and I recommend this to anyone who uses tkinter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this site, we use tkinter as <code>tk</code>, and ttk as <code>ttk</code> you probably already know why.
